Cobble is a simple SuperTux level editor designed to do quick drafts of
version-2 levels on Windows. To build it, get SharpDevelop, open Cobble.sln
and click Build.

The editor expects to be run with the current working directory to the
SuperTux base directory, so either set the CWD in the Debug Options or
copy it there.

Cobble is distributed under the GPL.
